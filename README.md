# Exercise-04c-Enemies

## Implementation
I created the four levels which are pretty diverse as I was experimenting to try to make them difficult.
I added the respawn. If you fall off the map, you respawn at level 1.
I created and added sounds for collecting coins, colliding with enemies, and spawning/respawning into a level
